# Random color generator
My solution for a task asked by [Solid Software](https://solid.software/).

The task was to build a small app with one screen. And when clicking anywhere on the screen change the background color to a randomly generated color.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework with version *3.7.12* -  App SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps
* Please follow setup instructions for [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1tGUBhDXARIsAIJx01mOUukzIfbSzl-uooPf07EzZr6h6fDr6mPJuDSsVTJ0Fl-QNjevreEaAvhHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

You can check if there are any requirements missing with this command
```

```

### Installing
